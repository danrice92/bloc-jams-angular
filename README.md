## Bloc Frontend Project Starter

This is my repo for Bloc Jams Angular, a refactor of my original [Bloc Jams project](https://github.com/danrice92/bloc-jams) in order to incorporate Angular JavaScript. It is a music player web app with a splashy landing page, an album collection page, and an album page from which a user can play music and skip between songs.
